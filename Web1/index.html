            <p>
              <strong> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</strong>,
              often shortened to Hogwarts, was a Scottish wizarding school
              located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted any magical student
              residing in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland at the age of
              eleven years old at the start of the incoming term for enrolment.
              It was a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic. The
              precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it
              was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an
              old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools'
              locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of
              teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and
              schools themselves from any harm.

            <h2>About it's <span>History</span></h2>
            <p>
              Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest
              wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga
              Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each
              represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out
              in new students. They also placed certain protective enchantments
              in place to ensure the well-being of their students, for which
              reason the castle and grounds had both always been protected with
              Anti-Apparition Charms. Around the same time, the four founders
              employed the school's first Caretaker, Hankerton Humble, who would
              often clash with Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, which he would
              have in common with every successive caretaker after him in the
              history of Hogwarts. Although the four founders cooperated well
              for a time, however, shortly after founding the school, Slytherin
              had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and
              wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded
              students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such
              as Muggle-borns and half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three
              founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the
              school, but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets.
              He foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it once
              they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous
              basilisk living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born
              students. Despite the fact that the founders of Hogwarts were
              effectively in charge of the school during their time, none of
              them held the title of headmaster or headmistress of the school,
              as that was only used sometime after Slytherin's departure, and
              held by another wizard, who was the first person to be entrusted
              the stewardship of Hogwarts Castle and the surrounding grounds
              after the three remaining founders passed away.

            <h2>About the <span>Enrollment</span></h2>
            <p>
              Each year, the
              <strong> Hogwarts Deputy Headmaster </strong>
              sent letters to eligible witches and wizards who would be eleven
              years old at the start of the incoming term. These letters invited
              the children to be students at Hogwarts. If for any reason a
              letter did not reach its intended recipient, owls would continue
              delivering letters until the person received one. The letter
              contained a list of needed supplies, signed by the Chief Attendant
              of Witchcraft Provisions, Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus, which
              included uniform clothing, spell books, and cauldrons. Letters
              were also sent to existing students to inform them of the new
              supplies needed. Students usually obtained school supplies at
              Diagon Alley in London. Letters to Muggle-born witches and
              wizards, who may not have been aware of their powers and were
              unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, were delivered in
              person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explained to the
              parents/guardians about magical society, and reassured them
              regarding this news. They also assisted the family in regards to
              buying supplies and gaining access to Diagon Alley.
