                <h2>Astronomy</h2>
                <p>
                  Astronomy is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts
                  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is the branch of magic
                  and science that studies stars and the movement of planets.
                  Students use their wands with an Orrery to predict the next
                  eclipse, the only known practical form of magic used in the
                  class. Astronomy lessons are spent learning the names of stars
                  and the movements of planets. It is a required class from year
                  one until year five, and becomes an optional subject for the
                  final two years.

                <h2>Charms</h2>
                <p>
                  Charms is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School
                  of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unsurprisingly, it specializes in
                  the teaching of charms. Even though mastering charm-work is
                  clearly essential to performing the greater part of magic,
                  charm-work is seen as a "softer option" by some. Charms is a
                  required subject for all students in their first five years at
                  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The spells learned
                  in Charms class are taken from textbooks. Students are taught
                  specific wand movements and proper pronunciation. Often,
                  students partner up in class to experiment on one another.

                <p>
                  Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) is a
                  subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
                  and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this
                  class, students study and learn how to defend themselves
                  against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark
                  creatures, curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms), and
                  dueling. Defence Against the Dark Arts is a required subject
                  from first year to fifth year. The curriculum of the class
                  varies greatly depending on what the professor at the time
                  deems appropriate.

                  Flying, also known as Broom Flight Class, is a subject taught
                  at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is taught by
                  Madam Rolanda Hooch, the Hogwarts Flying Instructor and
                  Quidditch referee. The subject teaches students how to fly
                  broomsticks. The course aims of these lessons are largely
                  aimed towards providing students with a basic understanding of
                  the only the most elementary principles behind the study of
                  broomology, which is to say, both how to handle a broom and
                  progressively work on various techniques and maneuvers
                  performed while in flight, as well as receiving proper
                  instructions on the subject of proper broom care and
                  maintenance.

                <p>
                  Herbology is the study of magical and mundane plants and
                  fungi, making it the wizarding equivalent to botany. Herbology
                  is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of
                  Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students learn to care
                  for and utilize plants, learn about their magical properties
                  and what they are used for. Many plants provide ingredients
                  for potions and medicine, while others have magical effects of
                  their own right. Herbology is a mandatory class at Hogwarts
                  for the first five years of a student's education. Students
                  spend class time learning about the different varieties of
                  magical plants that exist. The further into a student's
                  education, the more difficult and dangerous the plants become.

                  History of Magic is a core class and subject taught at
                  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The class involves
                  studying magical history and doesn't require the use of magic.
                  From the first year to the fifth, students learn about the
                  'History of Wizards and the Magical World,' with a focus on
                  remembering dates, names, and events. The class is completed
                  with an O.W.L. exam that only has a written section.

                  Potions is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School
                  of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students learn how
                  to brew potions using specific recipes and various magical
                  ingredients, starting with simple ones and progressing to more
                  advanced ones. Potions is a required subject for students from
                  the first year to the fifth year. While potion recipes can be
                  found in books, the intricacies of timing, ageing, stirring
                  techniques, and bottling are more difficult to learn without
                  the guidance of experienced masters.

                  Transfiguration is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts
                  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It involves learning the
                  art of changing the form and appearance of an object or
                  person, commonly known as "Transfiguration." The magic is
                  considered complex and dangerous, with limits governed by
                  Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. There are many
                  branches of Transfiguration, including Trans-Species
                  Transformation and Human Transfiguration. It's regarded as
                  "very hard work" and "more scientific" than charms-work.
                  Transfiguration is required for all first-year to fifth-year
                  students, with an option for a N.E.W.T. course in the sixth
                  and seventh year.
