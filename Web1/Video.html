  At the starting of the scene Alastor Moody introduces himself, that he is an
  ex-auror, and only teaches this class, because Dumledore asked him to. After
  he mentions, that he believes in a practical way of teching he already
  mentiones and asks the class if anyone knows how many unforgivable curses
  there are. Hermione answers with the right answer, three. Then he asks why
  they're called unforgivable curses. Hermione answers again. They are called
  unforgivable, because they are actually unforgivable. - They are a one way
  ticket to Azkaban. - Moody finishes the answer. After this Moody starts
  explaining how, although the Ministry thinks that they shouldn't learn about,
  but he thinks that they should be prepared for anything and for any spell.
  During this scene he uses his magic eye to catch on of the students putting
  some gum to the under side of his table, revealing his abbility to see through
  solid objects. Then he asks Ron which curse they should start with. He
  mentions that his father told him about the Imperius curse. Moody mentions
  that his father should know some about that because his work at the Ministry,
  mentioning that they had some kind of grief about it a few years ago. After
  this moody takes out a spider like creature from a china cabinet, enlarges it
  with the spell Engorgio and then uses the spell Imperio on it. Under the spell
  the creature is unable to move on it's own and has to move as the wizard
  wants, which results in Moody moving it from student to student laughing at
  them and telling them it is not harmful, it can't do an√≠thing on it's own.
  Then it shows how it's completely vulnerable to the one casting the spell by
  almost throwing it out of the window or drowning itself. After this he
  explanes that a huge bunch of witches and wizards claimed that thex only did
  You-Know-Who's bidding under the influence of the Imperius curse, implicating
  that it is hard to filter the liars. The next curse is up and he asks the
  class to call on another one. The camera is closing on on Neville raising his
  hand. Moody asks his name - Longbottom, is it? Mentioning, that according to
  Professor Sprout he has a green thumb, a good affinity for Herbology, he
  agrees. Neville says that the next is the Cruciatus Curse. Moody approves
  approves and invites neville to his table to examine the spell from closer. He
  explains that it is the torture curse. After casting the spell on the creature
  it starts to yell like it's crying and you can see on Neville's face that he's
  feeling awful like he has some kind of trauma about the spell. After a while
  Hermione yells to Moody to stop it, like he didn't see that it bothers
  Neville. After he notices and stops, he takes the creature to Hermione's table
  and asks her for the last curse. She declines and then he cast the killing
  curse, Avada Kedavra. After the creature dies, he explains that only one
  person is known to have survived it and he's sitting in this room, looking at
  Harry, while moving closer to his table and taking out his flask drink some
  from it.
